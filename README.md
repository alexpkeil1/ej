Slides and materials for the 2022 Environmental Justice Bootcamp talk entitled "Optimism via causal inference in environmental injustice" by Alex Keil

Data and R code are provided to replicate the second example given in the talk, which is a plasmode simulation study with the goal of estimating the joint effects of reducing race-based disparities in biomarker exposures. The analysis is motivated by exposure inequities that are driven in part by environmental justice concerns. This approach provides a novel way to directly estimate the impact of reducing exposure inequities.
